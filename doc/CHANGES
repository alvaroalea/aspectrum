v 0.1.4  - 08-08-2001
--------------------------------------------------------------------
 - Added the use of Allegro GUI routines to select the files to
   load or save. They're not nice but... they work! Thanks another
   time to Allegro guys :)

 v 0.1.3  - 07-07-2001
--------------------------------------------------------------------
 - Added internationalization support: 3 languages till now, and
   it's quite easy to add new languages just by modifying langs.h .
 - Added dialogs to load (typing) a SNA, SP or Z80 file. Those
   dialogs will be used until a directory browsing routine is
   contributed or developed by me.
 - Quite important: I've added AUTO FrameRate Adjust. This means
   that slow computers (P100, P120, P133...) can now play Aspectrum
   at 50 REAL spectrum FPS (although they'll see on the screen not
   the 50 screen updates). I've tested it on a P120 Laptop (a laptop
   is slower than a desktop computer), under XWindow at 16 bpp (this
   means real time 8 bpp to 16 bpp color conversion) and games were
   playable at 50 fps (I imagine that the screenupdate rate was about
   20). Under Linux console the emulator works perfectly, and under
   MSDOS you'll reach the 50 fps even with 486DX2 or DX4 computers...

 v 0.1.2  - 07-07-2001
--------------------------------------------------------------------
 - F1 now shows a simple GUI.
 - F2 now save snapshots (.SNA files) as snapshot.sna
 - F3 now load snapshot.sna from disk.

   (SCR file, 6192 bytes in size: you can convert it to gif using
   the scr2gif utility).
 - F5 now resets the Spectrum.
 - Wrapped all graphical functions into v_alleg.* files.
 - Added IND-INDR-INIR-OTIR-OUTD-OTDR opcodes by MetalBrain.
 - Corrected timing for LD L, [HL] from 4 to 7 t-states.
   Thanks for Jaime Tejedor alias MetalBrain <metalbrain_coder@gmx.net>
 - Added OUTI opcode thanks to Alvaro Alea.
 - Updated the WORKING file (lots of games tested).
 
 v 0.1.1  - 12-05-2001
--------------------------------------------------------------------
 - Added Z80 snapshot (type 1, 2 and 3) file support.
   Corrected Makefile to compile only modifyed files.
   Patch submitted by Alvaro Alea <ALEAsoft@yahoo.com>.
   Alvaro is the first Patch Contributor of Aspectrum,
   althought it's not the first that helps on the emulator,
   as Kak found some bugs on my code telling me on
   #spectrum channel on libres.irc-hispano.org .
 - Decremented R register on default: case of op_dd_fd.c
   (thanks to Raul Gomez for this one).
