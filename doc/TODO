 ASPECTRUM EMULATOR TO-DO 
============================================================================

 BUGS:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Some games blink when playing them, as Ghould And Ghosts. It's maybe
   something related with the video interruption or maybe the timing I'm
   using, no idea :(

 - TAP loading routine is not working right for some games, maybe it's due
   to z80core emulation bugs :(

 - Look for badly implemented Z80 opcodes.
 

 EMULATOR:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Modify disasm.c and create a good disassemble routine
   Finish disassembler (@ simbols)
 
 - Function DrawScanLine(int linea);
   Update screen each scanline, not each screen (224 tstates, 321 lines).
 - Add undocumented opcodes.

 - Improve TAP loading routine to detect errors and so on...
 - Add real-time TAP loading routine.
 - Add TZX loading routine.


 - Implement menu option for changing the TAPFILE and Rewind.
   By default make tapfile = NULL. On a LOAD "" , if tapfile == NULL
   ask for a tapfile, else load the opened tapfile.
   On the tapfile menu put the following:

    - Select tapfile
    - rewind tapfile
   

 - Implement frameskip correctly so that older computers can use Aspectrum.

 - fix some scare_mouse and unscare_mouse that Alea put very happyly.

 - Eliminate al machine depend code (main.c, NO_GETOPTLONG ) and allegro version
   depend. (menu.c and vallegro.c)

 - See what happends with (my) mouse in Linux Console
 
 DOCUMENTATION:
