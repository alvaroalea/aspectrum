  HOW TO INSTALL THIS PROGRAM
=======================================================================
 In order to compile Aspectrum you need to have the adecuate devel enviroment,
 you must have GCC, GNU Make and Allegro compiled.
 Also if you are using the CVS version, need the agup-0.9.2 code.

 The Supported Arquitectures are:
 - Win32 (95 o later with DirectX 7 o later) using Mingw32
 - MS Dos using DJGPP and a VGA card
 - Linux i86 (at least Debian) Console and X11

 This platfoms with other compilers, and QNX, MacOS X (with X11 server) 
 and Linux no i86 have chances of work as long as Allegro can be compiled 
 on this platforms, please report any sucess or fail on this.
 
 Uncompress the source tarball and just type the following:

    make todo 

 You can execute directly the emulator by running the aspectrum
 binary as ./aspectrum. At this moment it only runs on the same
 directory that has been compiled, that's because this program
 is still in a full development stage and it's not for the
 end-user...

 There is a experimental make install but no make uninstall... :-)
 
 In some enviroments perhaps you need to create and tune a allegro.cfg file,
 please refer to the allegro DOC for more information.
 Also un Linux Console you can need to make the aspectrum executable suid.


  CU!
