  HOW TO INSTALL THIS PROGRAM
=======================================================================

 Just type the following (as root):

    make clean
    make

 You can execute directly the emulator by running the aspectrum
 binary as ./aspectrum. At this moment it only runs on the same
 directory that has been compiled, that's because this program
 is still in a full development stage and it's not for the
 end-user...

 There is no make install nor make uninstall...


  CU!
