 Raúl Gómez:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
 - 10-05-2001: Raúl found a small bug on op_dd_fd.c in the default:
               case, as I was not decrementing the R register on it.

 - Help on tap loading routines.
 - He helped me a lot in the firsts steps of my emulator with
   some ROM routines and the first bugs on some opcodes...
 - He gave me lots of ideas about the emulation.


 Ignacio Burgueño:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
 - He tested my emulator against his GLECK Spectrum Emulator to
   help me on finding bad implemented opcodes. This helped a lot.
 

 Philip Kendall:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
 - He allowed me to use his flags code from his Fuse Spectrum
   emulator. This accelerated the development a lot, as I had
   some errors emulating flags in some opcodes...


 Marat Fayzullin:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
 - He released the source code for his Z80 core emulator, and I
   learnt a lot from it. It's "How to program an emulator" HOWTO
   is also quite interesting.


 Tony Brazil:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
 - Game testing & reports for the WORKING and NOT_WORKING files.
 

 Santiago Romero:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
 - That's me, the author :-)
